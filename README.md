Spiced Cookies
==============

Adds a little bit of spice to your Cookie Clicker gameplay.

This is a collection of small modifications to the game Cookie Clicker.
Every single feature can be either ignored or disabled in the settings,
and most of them start disabled by default.

All the features are listed below.


Save the history of stock market prices (enabled by default)
============================================================

Vanilla Cookie Clicker only saves the current price of the stock in the save file.
This mod saves the entire history for all stocks,
up to 65 data points
(which is enough to fill the minigame's diagram).


Display the delta of stock market goods (enabled by default)
============================================================

Despite saving the current price for stock market goods,
vanilla Cookie Clicker displays two values when loading a save file.
The first value is actually the current price minus the delta
instead of the previous value;
so actually the delta _is_ available for players,
just not in a straightforward way.
This mod shows the delta below the value of each stock.
